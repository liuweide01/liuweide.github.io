## About Me
<!-- I am currently a Scientist at Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR), Singapore. Previously, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s Degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) at 2014. After that, I obtained my Master degree and Ph.D degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore at 2016 and 2020, respectively, under the supervision of Prof. Wang Jianliang, Prof. Wen Changyun and Prof. Lin Guosheng. I also cooperated with Prof. Yuan Junsong. -->
